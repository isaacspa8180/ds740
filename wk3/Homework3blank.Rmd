<span style="color:DarkViolet">Set the random seed equal to 3.  Perform 10-fold cross-validation to choose the best size of model (from 1 to 41 variables) based on cross-validation MSE.  Record the mean squared error within each fold for each size of variable.  **Note**: This step will probably take a few minutes to run!

### <span style="color:DarkViolet">Question 11</span> **<span style="color:Crimson">(4 points)</span>**
<span style="color:DarkViolet">Use $\texttt{regsubsets}$ to find the best model for the whole data set which has the number of variables you found in the previous question.  Write 4-6 sentences interpreting the signs of the coefficients.  Include possible explanations for the associations.  **Note**: It may be helpful to refer to the data dictionary and/or a map of Wisconsin, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin#/media/File:Wisconsin-counties-map.gif.

## <span style="color:DarkViolet">Problem 2:  Logistic Regression  </span>
#####################################################

<span style="color:DarkViolet">In this problem, you will use logistic regression to predict whether a car has low or high gas mileage.</span>

### <span style="color:DarkViolet">Question 12</span> **<span style="color:Crimson">(2 points)</span>**
<span style="color:DarkViolet">Write R code to:  </span>

* Load the **Auto** data set into R.  The data set is in the ISLR library.  
* Create a binary variable that equals 1 for cars with gas mileage above the median and a 0 for cars with gas mileage below the median.  Tell R to treat it as a factor.  
* Tell R to treat the origin variable as a factor.  

<span style="color:DarkViolet">Enter your R code below.</span>

<span style="color:green">**Code Answer**: </span>
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Question 12

### <span style="color:DarkViolet">Question 13</span> **<span style="color:Crimson">(2 points)</span>**
<span style="color:DarkViolet">Make a matrix of scatterplots of the variables in **Auto**.  Do you have any concerns about collinearity?  If so, for which variables?  Explain.</span>

### <span style="color:DarkViolet">Question 14</span> **<span style="color:Crimson">(2 points)</span>**

### <span style="color:DarkViolet">Question 15</span> **<span style="color:Crimson">(1 points)</span>**
<span style="color:DarkViolet">Compute the variance inflation factor for each of the predictor variables in the model.  Which variable(s) have VIFs greater than or equal to 10?</span>

<span style="color:green">**Multiple SELECT Answer** </span>
**<span style="color:red">(AUTOGRADED on D2L)</span>**:  
cylinders,  

	
displacement,  

	
horsepower, and/or

	
weight

### <span style="color:DarkViolet">Question 16</span> **<span style="color:Crimson">(4 points)</span>**
<span style="color:DarkViolet">Remove any variables with VIFs greater than or equal to 10.  Set the random seed equal to 3 and perform 10-fold cross-validation.  In each phase of the cross-validation, fit the logistic model (excluding name, continuous mpg, and the variable(s) you found in the previous question and predict the probability of high gas mileage for each data point in the validation set.  Store all of the probabilities in a single vector.  
**Note**:  Depending on how you set up the formula in the logistic regression, the predict function may give an error, “Factor name has new levels.”  This is complaining about the fact that there are models of car in the validation set that weren’t included in the training data.  But, it’s not really a problem, because we’re not using name as a predictor variable.  You can create a new data frame that excludes name, or you can update the levels of the name factor in the logistic model, as shown here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22315394/factor-has-new-levels-error-for-variable-im-not-using
